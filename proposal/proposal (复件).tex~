\section{Introduction}
Pedestrian detection is a key problem in computer vision,
with several applications that have the potential to positively
impact quality of life.\\\indent
Pedestrian detection is a difficult task from a machine
vision perspective. The lack of explicit models leads to the
use of machine learning techniques, where an implicit
representation is learned from examples.
While there is much ongoing research in machine
vision approaches for detecting pedestrians, varying
evaluation protocols and use of different data sets makes
direct comparisons difficult.
